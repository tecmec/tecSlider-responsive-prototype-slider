tecSlider - a responsive prototype slider
==========================================

##Demands on this project:

The slider should be fast, lightweight, easy to configure and especially backward compatible to older browsers, like IE6+.

##Todo:
* add different animation options, such as slide
* make controls work

For anything else watch the __issue__ and __pull request__ list.
